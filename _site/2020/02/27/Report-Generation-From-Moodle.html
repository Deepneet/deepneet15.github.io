<p>1    IntroductionMoodle is a learning platform designed to provide educators, administrators andlearners  with  a  single  robust,  secure  and  integrated  system  to  create  person-alised learning environments.  Moodle is designed to support both teaching andlearning as it delivers a powerful set of learner-centric tools and collaborativelearning  environments  that  empowers  both  functionalities.A  simple  interface,drag-and-drop features, and well-documented resources along with ongoing us-ability improvements makes Moodle easy to learn and use.  It is an open-sourceplatform,  it  can  be  customised  in  any  way  and  tailored  to  individual  needs.Its modular set up and interoperable design allows developers to create pluginsand integrate external applications to achieve specic functionalities.  Moodleprovides wide range of functionalities including Attendance module.  The At-tendance activity allows Head of departments,teachers to maintain a record ofattendance,  replacing or supplementing a paper-based attendance register.  Itis primarily used in blended-learning environments where students are requiredto  attend  classes,  lectures  and  tutorials  and  allows  the  teacher  to  track  andoptionally provide a grade for the students attendance.  The instructor can setthe  frequency  of  their  classes  (  of  days  per  week   length  of  course)  or  createspecic sessions.   To take attendance, the teacher clicks on the “Update Atten-dance” button and is presented with a list of all the students in that course,along with congurable options and comments.  The default options providedare:  Present, Absent, Late  Excused.  Instructors can download the attendancefor their course in Excel format or text format.It allows teachers to be able take attendance during class, and for studentsto be able to view their own attendance record.A teacher can mark the attendance status of a student as “Present”, “Ab-sent”,  “Late”,  or “Excused”.   These status  descriptions are  congurable,  andmore can be added.  The teacher adds Attendance as an activity of a course,and then sets up the sessions whose attendance is to be tracked.The Attendance module can generate reports for either the entire class orfor individual students.  Students may also see their own attendance record ifthe activity is not hidden.  Reports generated from attendance module can thenbe used by head of departments,teachers and students.  Database makes recordof  all  the  information  generated  or  required  by  moodle.A  database  is  a  datastructure that stores organized information.  Most databases contain multipletables, which may each include several dierent elds.1

V. Shete2, S. B. Somani3, \Android Based Smart Learn-ing  and  AttendanceManagement  System”,  International  Journal  of  AdvancedResearch in Computer and Communication Engineering Vol.  4, Issue 6, June2015In[1]This  application  will  require  connecting  to  the  internet  through  Wi-Fi(Wireless Fidelity) technology or through GPRS(General Packet Radio Ser-vice).Lecturers will rst have to sign up for this and then they can take atten-dance any time they wish by rst logging in with the help of a smartphone tothe server.  After attendance has been taken lecturer will send it over to severvia GPRS.The lecturers can also enroll new students, delete information abouta particular student, modify some information etc.[2] The design and implementation of the system is to provide service in insti-tute and colleges.  The system is to provide comprehensive student informationsystem and user interface is to replace the current paper records.  College Stauploads  attendance,  results  and  college  notications  through  a  secure,  onlineinterface using android devices.  All data is thoroughly reviewed and validatedon the server before actual record alteration occurs.  The system plans for stu-dent user interface, allowing students to access tips and tricks as provided bytheir seniors.  All data is stored securely on SQL servers managed by the collegeAdministrator .In[3] In this paper basic problem of student attendance management is de-ned which is traditionally taken manually by faculty.  One alternative to makestudent attendance system automatic is provided by Computer Vision.  In thispaper we review the various computerized system which is being developed byusing dierent techniques.  Based on this review a new approach for student at-tendance recording and management is proposed to be used for various collegesor academic institutes.In[4] The purpose of developing attendance management system is to com-puterized the tradition way of taking attendance.  Another purpose for develop-ing this software is to generate the report automatically at the end ofthe sessionor in the between of the session.4    ObjectivesThe objectives behind this format are:Reduces admin work by integrating the details of the students of all thedierent departments into a single database.3
Manual work for information retrieval on attendance becomes less as thework becomes digitized.Easy access for students because they can view their attendance and makeup for the shortage of attendance accordingly.It is also time saving as manual work is less.There are less chances of errors.It eliminates duplicate data entries.It  can  keep  the  parents  informed  about  the  student’s  performance  viaEmails,alerts and generated reports.After implimentation of project:Easy to use GUI.Students can register online no rush for registration in placement depat-ment.Students can get informed by email or mobile notication automatically.List of weak students can be made in a single click.Reports of students can be generated on the basis of departments,subjectsor classes.Burden of academic cell decreases.Send  weekly  or  monthly  attendance  as  required  to  students  and  theirteachers.4
5    Feasibility StudyFeasibility  analysis  begins  once  the  goals  are  dened.It  starts  by  generatingbroad  possible  solutions,which  are  possible  to  give  an  indication  of  what  ourproject will look like.  This is where creativity and imagination is used.Analystsmust think up new ways of doing things-generate new ideas.  There is no needto  go  into  detailed  operation  systems  yet.   Feasibilty  of  a  new  system  meansensuring that the new system ,which we are going to impliment is ecient andaordable.  There are various types of feasibilities to be determined.  They are:Economic  Feasibilty-  Development  of  this  application  is  highly  feasible.The only thing to be done is making an environment with an eective super-vision.  It is cost eective in the sense that it has eliminated the paper workcompletely.Technical Feasibility- The techical requirement for the system is economicand it does not use any other additional Hardware and Software.Technical eval-uation must also assess whether the existing systems can be upgraded to usethe new technology and whether the organization has the expertise to use it.Operational Feasibility- The system working is quite easy to use and learndue to its simple but attractive interface .  User requires no special training foroperating the system .5
6    Requirement Specications:Hardware requirements-Ram- 2GBHard disk- 500GBProcessor- Intel Core i3Software requirements:Operating system- Ubuntu 18.04.4Front End language- PHPBack End language- MySqlFunctional requirements:  Report Generation system involves the followingfunctions:Easy tracking records of the students.Quickly produces attendance bulletin.Non- functional requirements:Performance- Easy tracking of records and updating can be done .  All therequirements related to performance characteristics of the system are speciedbelow:Static requirements- these requirements do not impose any constraints onthe execution characteristics of the system.  eg.  no.  of users and terminals.Dynamic requirements- These requirements impose constraints on the exe-cution characteristics of the system.eg.  Reliability,Security and Availability.6
7    Future ScopeThe project has vast scope in future .  The project can be implimented on in-tranet in future.Project can be updated in future as per requirements arised.Ranging from e-courses creation, user registration, assignment submission, learn-ing materials(even SCORM), exam/quiz, grading ,MOODLE oers the provisionfor associating virtual classroom as well.So Project is very 
exible in terms ofexpansion.7
