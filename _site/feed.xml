Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Moodle is designed to support both teaching andlearning as it delivers a powerful set of learner-centric tools and collaborativelearning  environments  that  empowers  both  functionalities.A  simple  interface,drag-and-drop features, and well-documented resources along with ongoing us-ability improvements makes Moodle easy to learn and use.  It is an open-sourceplatform,  it  can  be  customised  in  any  way  and  tailored  to  individual  needs.Its modular set up and interoperable design allows developers to create pluginsand integrate external applications to achieve specic functionalities.  Moodleprovides wide range of functionalities including Attendance module.  The At-tendance activity allows Head of departments,teachers to maintain a record ofattendance,  replacing or supplementing a paper-based attendance register.  Itis primarily used in blended-learning environments where students are requiredto  attend  classes,  lectures  and  tutorials  and  allows  the  teacher  to  track  andoptionally provide a grade for the students attendance.  The instructor can setthe  frequency  of  their  classes  (  of  days  per  week   length  of  course)  or  createspecic sessions.   To take attendance, the teacher clicks on the “Update Atten-dance” button and is presented with a list of all the students in that course,along with congurable options and comments.  The default options providedare:  Present, Absent, Late  Excused.  Instructors can download the attendancefor their course in Excel format or text format.It allows teachers to be able take attendance during class, and for studentsto be able to view their own attendance record.A teacher can mark the attendance status of a student as “Present”, “Ab-sent”,  “Late”,  or “Excused”.   These status  descriptions are  congurable,  andmore can be added.  The teacher adds Attendance as an activity of a course,and then sets up the sessions whose attendance is to be tracked.The Attendance module can generate reports for either the entire class orfor individual students.  Students may also see their own attendance record ifthe activity is not hidden.  Reports generated from attendance module can thenbe used by head of departments,teachers and students.  Database makes recordof  all  the  information  generated  or  required  by  moodle.A  database  is  a  datastructure that stores organized information.  Most databases contain multipletables, which may each include several dierent elds.1
